# Matrix Fundamentals

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that represent linear transformations, systems of equations, and robot configurations. They're fundamental to describing how robots move and transform through space.

## What is a Matrix?

A **matrix** is a 2D array of numbers arranged in rows and columns:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is a **2×3 matrix** (2 rows, 3 columns). We denote the element in row *i* and column *j* as *a<sub>ij</sub>*.

### Matrix Dimensions

- **Square matrix**: Same number of rows and columns (e.g., 2×2, 3×3)
- **Column vector**: *n*×1 matrix (single column)
- **Row vector**: 1×*n* matrix (single row)

<Example title="Robot Configuration Matrix" robotics>

A 6-DOF robot arm's joint angles can be represented as a column vector (6×1 matrix):

$$
\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix}
\theta_1 \\
\theta_2 \\
\theta_3 \\
\theta_4 \\
\theta_5 \\
\theta_6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where θ₁ through θ₆ are the joint angles.

</Example>

## Basic Matrix Operations

### Matrix Addition

Add corresponding elements. **Matrices must have the same dimensions.**

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
6 & 8 \\
10 & 12
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Matrix Subtraction

Subtract corresponding elements (same dimension requirement).

### Scalar Multiplication

Multiply every element by a scalar (number):

$$
3 \times \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 6 \\
9 & 12
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Transpose

The **transpose** of a matrix swaps rows and columns:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
A^T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 \\
2 & 5 \\
3 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The element at position (*i*, *j*) in *A* becomes position (*j*, *i*) in *A<sup>T</sup>*.

<Callout type="info" title="Properties of Transpose">

- (*A<sup>T</sup>*)<sup>T</sup> = *A*
- (*A* + *B*)<sup>T</sup> = *A<sup>T</sup>* + *B<sup>T</sup>*
- (*cA*)<sup>T</sup> = *c A<sup>T</sup>* (for scalar *c*)

</Callout>

## Special Matrices

### Identity Matrix

The **identity matrix** *I* is a square matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere:

$$
I_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

It acts like the number 1: *AI* = *IA* = *A*.

### Zero Matrix

All elements are zero. Acts like the number 0 in addition.

### Diagonal Matrix

Non-zero elements only on the diagonal:

$$
D = \begin{bmatrix}
d_1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & d_2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & d_3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

<Example title="PD Controller Gain Matrix" robotics>

A diagonal matrix naturally represents **proportional gains** in a PD controller for a 3-joint robot:

$$
K_p = \begin{bmatrix}
50 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 40 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 30
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The control torque is computed as $\boldsymbol{\tau} = K_p \cdot \mathbf{e}$, where $\mathbf{e}$ is the joint angle error vector. Each diagonal entry scales the error for one joint independently — this is a genuine matrix-vector multiplication used in every robot controller.

</Example>

## Linear Independence and Rank

Two concepts that are essential for understanding why matrices sometimes fail to be invertible.

### Linear Independence

A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if no vector in the set can be written as a combination of the others. Intuitively, each vector adds a genuinely **new direction**.

**Independent** — each vector points in a distinct direction:

$$
\vec{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \vec{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

**Dependent** — one vector is just a scaled version of the other:

$$
\vec{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \vec{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \quad (\vec{v}_1 = 2\vec{v}_2)
$$

When vectors are dependent, they span fewer dimensions than you'd expect. Two dependent 2D vectors only cover a line, not the full plane.

### Rank

The **rank** of a matrix is the number of linearly independent columns (equivalently, rows). A matrix is **full rank** when all its columns are independent.

For an *n*×*n* square matrix:
- **Full rank** (rank = *n*): The matrix is invertible, det ≠ 0
- **Rank-deficient** (rank < *n*): The matrix is singular, det = 0, columns are dependent

This is *why* singular matrices collapse space — dependent columns mean redundant directions, so the transformation squashes at least one dimension away.

<Callout type="info" title="Rank in Robotics">

The **Jacobian matrix** of a robot maps joint velocities to end-effector velocities. Its rank tells you how many **independent directions** the end-effector can move:
- **Full rank**: The robot can move in all directions — full dexterity
- **Rank drops**: The robot loses control in one or more directions — this is a **singularity**

When we say "the Jacobian is singular," we mean its columns have become linearly dependent, and the rank has dropped below its maximum value.

## Practice Problems

1. Compute $A + B$ and $3A$ for $A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & -2\\3 & 0\end{bmatrix}$, $B = \begin{bmatrix}4 & 1\\-1 & 5\end{bmatrix}$.

2. Find $A^T$ for the 2×3 matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & -3\\2 & 5 & 1\end{bmatrix}$. What are the dimensions of $A^T$?

3. Are these vectors linearly independent? $\vec{v}_1 = (1, 2, 3)$, $\vec{v}_2 = (2, 4, 6)$, $\vec{v}_3 = (0, 1, 1)$

4. A 2-joint robot's Jacobian has columns $(1, 0)$ and $(0.5, 0)$. What is the rank? Is the robot at a singularity?

<details>
<summary>**Answers**</summary>

1. $A + B = \begin{bmatrix}5 & -1\\2 & 5\end{bmatrix}$, $3A = \begin{bmatrix}3 & -6\\9 & 0\end{bmatrix}$

2. $A^T = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\0 & 5\\-3 & 1\end{bmatrix}$. Dimensions: **3×2** (rows and columns swap).

3. **No** — $\vec{v}_2 = 2\vec{v}_1$, so $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ are dependent. (Even though $\vec{v}_3$ is independent of $\vec{v}_1$, the set as a whole is dependent.)

4. Both columns are multiples of $(1, 0)$ — they point in the same direction. Rank = **1** (not full rank). Yes, the robot is at a **singularity** — it can only produce end-effector motion along the x-axis.
